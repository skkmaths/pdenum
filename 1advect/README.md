## Finite Difference scheme code  for 1D Advection equation: $u_t + a u_x = 0$
- Run the code as $python advect.py -Tf 1

## Home work
- Currently the code has written for Upwind scheme with periodic boundary condition
- Implement all the other numerical methods in the same file
- Implement the other types of boundary condition
- Compare the numerical results using different numerical schemes
- Use a discontinuous function as initial data etc.
